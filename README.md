# ADVANCED-AI-BASED-AGE-DETECTION-AND-OTT-CONTENT-CONTROLLING-SYSTEM

If the individual is not eligible to view the contents all specific data will be black marked in host database using selenium tool so the information or a task, their access will be limited; otherwise, their access will be allowed. Face detection has follow through and presented in this project by using a Haar cascade classifier. Generally, two rich techniques such as age estimation and face identification are required to restrict the access of internet for certain age people. Then this project has proposed a new combined framework for Face recognition and age detection for content controlling system. On the other hand, Children’s safety in social network as unrivalled of the primary requirements in today's world by developing a arrangement for computer imaginativeness complexness. The Content controlling of website will be exclusively distinct using this method. This project hold presented a method acting that employ both age detection and content controlling together to control the browser accurately. Computer vision mainly focus on the automatic extraction, depth psychology, and understanding of useful entropy from an individual epitome or video. Therefore, first this model detects the person's face, and then information technology predicts the age and finally the website is controlled using selenium tool.

The rapid growth of OTT Platforms has transformed how users consume Media. With diverse content accessible to audience of all ages, there is an increased need for responsible content control to protect young viewers from inappropriate material. Existing Parental Control on OTT Platforms typically rely on Manual Settings and age-based profiles, limiting their effectiveness in accurately filtering Content. However, these methods are often cumbersome, lack customization and sometimes fail to account for changing viewing preferences among young users. Every new technology brings along both excitement and anxiety. Although computer and Internet are increasingly indispensable tools for children and have many advantages in several areas, mainly in education, communication and creativity, computer and Internet use also cause anxiety because of violence in games, extreme use of computer, ease of accessing adult contents and other controversial content, invading privacy and Internet addiction. Generally, for education of children’s computer and internet has playing major role it’s important to restrict the unwanted contents from internet for children's so the two robust techniques such as age estimation and Content controlling are required to maintain authenticity. In reality, fraud and scams are getting increased, so here this project has proposed a new combined model for Content controlling and age prediction.

In today’s digital age, children’s safety on social networks is a paramount concern. the unrestricted access to internet content exposes minors to potential risks, including exposure in inappropriate material, cyber bullying and online predators. This study addresses the need for an advanced content control system that can effectively restrict internet access based on age verification. By integrating face recognition and age detection technologies, the proposed system aims to provide a robust solution for safeguarding children online. This research is crucial as it combines innovative computer vision techniques with practical application, ensuring a secure and controlled browsing environment for young users.

This project is classified as a Technical Research and Development Project with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Content Filtering. It combines elements of both Applied Research and Software Development, with a practical focus on solving real-world problems related to content accessibility and child safety on digital platforms. The project leverages AI-based age detection and machine learning for real-time content filtering on OTT platforms. By addressing the gap in existing content control systems, this project not only offers a practical solution to protect minors from harmful content but also contributes to the field of AI by exploring the integration of real-time age verification and content blocking in the entertainment industry. The project is both technically challenging and socially impactful, with broad applications in ensuring safer digital media consumption.

PYTHON 3.7:
 Python is an interpreter, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object- oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in manya reason most platforms and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off- line as well. 

THONNY   IDE:

Thonny is as mall and light weight Integrated Development Environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME, so Thonny only requires the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you only need the GTK2 runtime libraries installed to run it.        
For compiling Thonny yourself, you will need the GTK (>= 2.6.0) libraries and header files. You will also need the Pango, Gliband ATK libraries and header files. All these files are available at http://www.gtk.org. Furthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; a C++ compiler is also required for the included Scintilla library. The GNU versions of these tools are recommended.
Compiling Thonny is quite easy.Thonny detects an already running instance of itself and opens files from the command-line in the already running instance. So, Thonny can be used to view and edit files by opening them from other programs such as a file manager. If you do not like this for some reason, you can disable using the first instance by using the appropriate command line option.
